As long as the bond persists, the animal follows your character, and you dictate the animal\u2019s overall behavior (although, since the animal is only bonded with the character, not dominated, it may still perform inconvenient actions such as scratching furniture, consuming rations, and marking territory). Once per round in structured encounters, your character may spend one maneuver to direct their animal in performing one action and one maneuver during your character\u2019s turn. The animal must be within hearing and visual range of your character (generally medium range) to do this. Otherwise, the animal does not contribute to the encounter. The specifics of its behavior are up to you and your GM.  For every additional rank of Animal Companion your character has, increase the allowed silhouette of the companion by one (this may mean your character gets a new companion, or their companion grows in size).  This talent can also change in flavor depending on the nature of your game setting. While an animal companion may make sense in many settings, in a futuristic setting it may make more sense for the \u201canimal\u201d to be a robot or drone, for example."
